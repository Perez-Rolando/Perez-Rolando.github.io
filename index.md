# Rolando Perez's Portfolio

I am a sophmore Computer Science major in CSUF who is expected to graduate 2026.

## Favorite CPSC 120 labs

* Lab 3 Part 1:

  Lab 3 introduced the concept of calculating Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using a formula based on weight, height, and age. This lab stands out to me because it directly applies mathematical concepts to real-life scenarios, illustrating the practicality of programming. Through this exercise, I gained insight into the importance of understanding and applying formulas in various contexts, such as health and fitness. Additionally, it reinforced the significance of accurate input data and how slight variations can affect the outcome significantly.


* Lab 11 Part 1:

  Lab 11, Part 1, stands out to me as a favorite because it provided a practical application of file I/O and data manipulation. Through this lab, I learned how to read data from a CSV file, parse it, and utilize the extracted information to perform calculations. This process was particularly insightful as it simulated real-world scenarios where data analysis and interpretation are crucial. Additionally, working with classes and member functions to organize and manipulate data enhanced my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and their relevance in handling complex data structures effectively.


* Lab 12 Part 1:

  Lab 12, Part 1, also stands out to me as one of my favorites because it introduced the concept of image manipulation and animation using external libraries. Through this lab, I learned how to leverage libraries like Magick++ to generate visual effects programmatically. Creating an animated gradient demonstrated the intersection of mathematics, programming, and creativity, allowing me to explore the artistic possibilities within coding. Additionally, the process of building and utilizing lookup tables for sine functions enhanced my understanding of optimization techniques and the importance of precomputing data for performance-critical applications.
